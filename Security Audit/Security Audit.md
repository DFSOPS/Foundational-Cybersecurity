# Controls and compliance checklist exemplar

Type an X in the “yes” or “no” column to answer the question: Does Botium Toys currently have this control in place?

**Controls assessment checklist**

| **Yes** | **No** | **Control** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | X   | Least Privilege | All staff members now have access to client data; therefore, privileges must be restricted to lower the possibility of a breach. |
|     | X   | Disaster recovery plans | Plans for catastrophe recovery are nonexistent. Implementing these is necessary to guarantee business continuity. |
|     | X   | Password policies | The lack of strict password requirements for employees may make it easier for a threat actor to gain access to confidential information or other assets through employee work devices or the internal network. |
|     | X   | Separation of duties | Implementation is necessary to lessen the likelihood of fraud or unauthorised access to vital data, as the CEO of the company now oversees daily operations and payroll. |
| X   |     | Firewall | Traffic is blocked by the current firewall according to a suitably established set of security rules. |
|     |     |     |     |
|     | X   | Intrusion detection system (IDS) | IDS must be implemented by the IT department in order to assist in locating potential threat actor intrusions. |
|     | X   | Backups | In order to maintain business continuity in the event of a breach, the IT department must have backups of vital data. |
| X   |     | Antivirus software | The IT department routinely installs and maintains antivirus software. |
|     | X   | Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention for legacy systems | The usage of old systems is mentioned in the list of assets. The risk assessment shows that these systems are maintained and monitored, but there isn't a set timetable for doing so, and the intervention processes and rules aren't clear, which could put these systems at danger of being compromised. |
|     | X   | Encryption | Since encryption is not currently in use, putting it into practice would increase the secrecy of sensitive data. |
|     | X   | Password management system | Currently, there is no password management system in place; adding this control will increase the productivity of the IT department and other staff members in the event that password problems arise. |
| X   |     | Locks (offices, storefront, warehouse) | There are enough locks on the company's physical premises, which houses the storefront, product warehouse, and main offices. |
| X   |     | Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance | The actual site of the store has CCTV installed and operational. |
| X   |     | Fire detection/prevention (fire alarm, sprinkler system, etc.) Professional statement | The physical location of Botium Toys is equipped with a working fire detection and prevention system. |

**Recommendations :** In order to lower asset risks and strengthen Botium Toys' security posture, your IT manager should provide advice in this section that are relevant to controls and/or compliance requirements to stakeholders.

To strengthen Botium Toys' security posture and better guarantee the privacy of sensitive data, a number of controls—such as least privilege, disaster recovery plans, password policies, separation of duties, an intrusion detection system, continuing legacy system management, encryption, and a password management system—need to be put in place.

Botium Toys must put in place measures like encryption, separation of roles, and least privilege in order to address compliance gaps. Along with correctly classifying assets, the organisation must also determine what additional controls would need to be put in place in order to strengthen their security posture and better safeguard sensitive data.
