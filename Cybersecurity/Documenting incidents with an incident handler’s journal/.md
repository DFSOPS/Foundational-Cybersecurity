The organization made technical assistance requests to multiple entities for the analysis step.</li><li><strong>Containment, Eradication, and Recovery</strong>: The scenario outlines the actions the organization did to keep the crisis under control. For instance, the business terminated its computer networks.

Critical files were encrypted by the attackers' ransomware after they had access to the company's computers. Given that the ransom note the attackers left demanded a substantial payment in exchange for the decryption key, it would seem that their purpose was financial in nature.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Additional notes</p></td><td><ol><li>How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?</li><li>Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?</li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table>

A network protocol analyzer with a graphical user interface is called Wireshark. The ability for security analysts to record and examine network traffic is what makes Wireshark valuable in the field of cybersecurity. Investigating and identifying harmful activities may be aided by this.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The 5 W's</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>Who</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>What</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Where</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>When</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Why</strong>: N/A</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Additional notes</p></td><td><p>I was eager to get started on this exercise and examine a packet capture file because I had never used Wireshark before. The interface seemed very daunting at first. I understand why it's a really useful tool for analyzing network traffic.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

With the command-line interface, one can access Tcpdump, a network protocol analyser. Similar to Wireshark, tcpdump is useful in cybersecurity because it makes network traffic collection, filtering, and analysis possible for security experts.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The 5 W's</p></td><td><ul><li><strong>Who</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>What</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Where</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>When</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Why</strong>: N/A</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Additional notes</p></td><td><p>Using the command-line interface to capture and filter network traffic was difficult for me because I'm still learning how to use it. I used the incorrect commands a few times, which caused me to get stuck. However, I was able to complete this task and record network traffic after closely following the directions and going through several of the procedures again.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr><th><p><strong>Date:</strong> July 27 2024</p></th><th><p><strong>Entry:</strong></p><p>#4</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>Description</p></td><td><p>Investigate a suspicious file hash</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tool(s) used</p></td><td><p>I utilised VirusTotal, an investigative program, for this task. It scans files and URLs for harmful information, including trojans, worms, and viruses. If you want to quickly see whether a website or file that may be a sign of compromise has been flagged as malicious by other members of the cybersecurity community, this is a very useful tool. I utilised VirusTotal to examine a file hash that was flagged as harmful for this task.
</p><p>This incident occurred in the <strong>Detection and Analysis</strong> phase. I was placed in the position of a security analyst at a SOC looking into a questionable file hash in this scenario. I had to conduct further research and analysis once the security measures in place identified the suspicious file in order to ascertain whether the warning actually represented a threat.

Should we consider improving security awareness training so that employees are careful with what they click on?</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<table><tbody><tr><th><p>Reflections/Notes:</p><ol><li><strong>Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?</strong></li></ol><p>The tcpdump activity was pretty difficult for me. It took me a while to get used to the syntax of a tool like tcpdump because I'm new to utilising the command line. I was first really annoyed because I wasn't receiving the desired results. I corrected my mistakes and completed the task again. This taught me to carefully study the directions and proceed cautiously with the process.
</p><ol><li><strong>Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?</strong></li></ol><p>My comprehension of incident detection and response has undoubtedly changed as a result of taking this course. I had a rudimentary understanding of detection and reaction at the start of the course, but I was unaware of the complexity required. As the course went on, I gained knowledge of the event lifecycle, the significance of people, procedures, and plans, as well as the tools that were employed. In general, I believe that my perspective has evolved and that I now know and comprehend incident detection and response better.
</p><ol><li><strong>Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?</strong></li></ol><p>Using network protocol analyser tools to apply what I learnt about network traffic analysis was a really fun experience for me. It was fascinating and challenging because it was my first experience learning about network traffic analysis. Being able to use tools to record and analyse network data in real time really piqued my interest. I have a strong desire to learn more about this subject and eventually aim to master the use of network protocol analyser tools.
